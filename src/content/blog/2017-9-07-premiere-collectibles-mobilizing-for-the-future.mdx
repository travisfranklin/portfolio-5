excerpt: America's Largest Autographed Book Store was losing sales despite growing traffic. Analytics revealed the culprit - 70% mobile users couldn't complete purchases on their non-mobile-friendly site. I redesigned their e-commerce platform to be fully responsive and mobile-optimized.

#### The Problem

Premiere Collectibles calls itself America's Largest Autographed Book Store, but there's a problem. They are quickly losing that distinction. Book purchases are beginning to wane, and they didn't know why. They've seen incredible growth for years and years, but suddenly the market is drying up? Something isn't right.

#### Research

I began looking at Premiere's analytics and found that their website traffic and confirmed that their traffic had grown a great deal in the past year, but their conversions had begun to wane. The culprit was one a lot of businesses have run into in the past decade. Their userbase had grown to a whopping 70% mobile. The issue was that their site wasn't mobile-friendly at all. In-fact for many users at mobile resolutions, purchases couldn't even be made!

#### The old site

/>

#### The new mobile-friendly layout

#### The Results were immediately apparent

The added useability alongside the SEO benefits Google provides sites that are mobile-friendly benefitted us greatly leading into the holiday season. The company saw a nearly **30% increase** in conversions compared to the previous year, and nearly **90% higher** add-to-cart rate.

So if you haven't made your site mobile friendly, do it! Do it now!
