title: 'Bulk Books: A modern, tech-focused dynamo gets a bright new look.'
excerpt: I redesigned BulkBooks.com with three key objectives - target specific market segments, adapt quickly to new opportunities, and surpass all competitors in modernity. The result was a mobile-friendly site with bold visuals, targeted verticals, and custom content capabilities.

#### When I set out to re-design BulkBooks.com I was given three objectives  

1. Give us the ability to directly target certain market segments.  
2. Create a means for BulkBooks.com to adapt quickly to new market opportunities and trends.  
3. Make us more modern than all of our competitors.  

#### Here's the old site
<ImageGallery
  images={[{ src: "/bulkbooks_oldsite.jpg", alt: "BulkBooks old homepage design" }]}
/>

It's a workhorse, for sure, and arguably already more modern than many of its competitors, but we knew it could be better.

#### Here's the new site
<ImageGallery
  images={[{ src: "/bulkbooks_head.jpg", alt: "BulkBooks homepage design" }]}
/>

We made books bold and visible above the fold and drew attention to them with some basic parallax. Our CTA is pure and bold. Site visitors now know clearly what BulkBooks.com offers, and what to do about it. Search! On top of this, the site is also formatted to be more mobile-friendly as we have seen market trends shifting towards more mobile purchases. This is all very exciting, but we haven't even scratched the surface of what we changed.

  images={[
    { src: "/bulkbooks_verticals1.jpg", alt: "BulkBooks vertical page design 1" },
    { src: "/bulkbooks_verticals2.jpg", alt: "BulkBooks vertical page design 2" },
    { src: "/bulkbooks_verticals3.jpg", alt: "BulkBooks vertical page design 3" },
    { src: "/bulkbooks_verticals4.jpg", alt: "BulkBooks vertical page design 4" }
  ]}
  columns={4}
  height={'279px'}
/>

#### Verticals

Now when BulkBooks targets a market, they don't just send users to their front page, they send them to a page with catered content, increasing user engagement through relevance. The best part about this is that more verticals can be added easily as marketing efforts expand.

<ImageGallery
  images={[
    { src: "/bulkbooks_article1.jpg", alt: "Article page design 1" },
    { src: "/bulkbooks_article2.jpg", alt: "Article page design 2" },
    { src: "/bulkbooks_article3.jpg", alt: "Article page design 3" }
  ]}
  height={"200px"}
/>

#### Custom Articles

We were tasked with providing a means for BulkBooks.com to rapidly adapt to market trends. This was solved through a battery of pages for articles, lists, and special categories, all designed for crystal clear readability, and SEO.

I'm happy to say that BulkBooks.com has really exploded out of the gate with its new website design focused on user relevance, throughput, and SEO. You can view the new site (along with the fancy-dancy parallax animations) [here](http://www.bulkbooks.com)!
