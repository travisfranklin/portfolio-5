#### Udacity FEND Project 2

This project focused on creating a game to spec using vanilla Javascript. You can view the project [here](https://travisfranklin.github.io/FEND-Project2/)!

#### Instructions

A star will be deducted after so many failed moves, so strain that brain!

- After 9 Moves, you get 2 stars.
- After 12 Moves, you only get 1 star.
- I may adjust these scores in the future. This is as hard as the game could be.

#### Dependencies

- FontAwesome 4.7
- GreenSock's TweenMax.js (for that fancy-dancy fade-in effect)

#### Future Updates

- I want some cooler icons. FA gets the job done, but something more stylized and abstract, even runic would better fit the feel. The only issue is that they'll need to be implemented using a class system similar to FA due to the way the JS is written. This is probably more work than it's worth.
- A leaderboard would be great, although, without a database, it would only be local, and even then without cookies, all scores would be lost on page load.
- Breaks in some mobile sizes.
